# UX Improvement: Auto-Disable Parent Nodes

## Overview

This improvement enhances the user experience in the Table Field Management by implementing automatic parent node disabling when all of its children are disabled.

## Implementation Details

### Previous Behavior

- When a user disabled a child node, the parent node remained enabled, even if all its children were disabled
- Parent nodes had to be manually disabled, which could lead to confusion since a parent with all disabled children shouldn't logically be enabled
- Only bottom-up propagation for enabling was implemented (when enabling a child, parents were automatically enabled)

### New Behavior

- Top-down propagation: When disabling a parent node, all its children are automatically disabled (already implemented)
- Bottom-up propagation for enabling: When enabling a child, all ancestor nodes (including root) are automatically enabled (already implemented)
- **New bottom-up propagation for disabling**: When the last child of a parent is disabled, the parent is automatically disabled to provide visual feedback
- This behavior works for both "Expose" and "Allow Override" toggles independently

## Key Functions

1. `updateParentExposedBasedOnChildren` / `updateParentExposedBasedOnChildrenTraditional`:
   - Check if all direct children of a parent are disabled for exposure
   - If yes, automatically disable the parent node
   - When a parent is disabled for exposure, also disable its overridable state

2. `updateParentOverrideBasedOnChildren` / `updateParentOverrideBasedOnChildrenTraditional`:
   - Check if all direct children of a parent have override disabled
   - If yes, automatically disable the parent node's override

3. `propagateChildrenStatesToParents` / `propagateChildrenStatesToParentsTraditional`:
   - Process the entire field hierarchy to update parent states based on children states
   - Work from the deepest nodes upward to ensure proper propagation

## Integration

These new functions are called in the `useFieldManagement` hook when:
1. A field is disabled for exposure (`handleExposeChange`)
2. A field is disabled for override (`handleOverrideChange`)

The propagation is applied to both the typed ValueConfiguration and the traditional field structure to ensure consistency across both APIs.

## Benefits

- More intuitive and consistent UX where the UI reflects the logical state of the hierarchy
- Reduced manual toggle clicks needed from users
- Visual feedback that immediately reflects the actual state of the configuration
- Maintains symmetrical propagation (both top-down and bottom-up) for a complete mental model

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various scenarios:
- Disabling all children to verify parent auto-disables
- Re-enabling a single child to verify parent enables
- Disabling children individually until all are disabled
- Testing with nested hierarchies to ensure proper propagation at all levels
